            <img class="person__img" src="assets/img/stella.jpg" alt="Stella Atiya" title="Stella Atiya">
            <p>My life was busy. The male attention I received going out was not up to par, and I was over the one or two date experiences that were ‚Äúblah.‚Äù I had been dabbling in online dating and nothing was ever panning out, and so I decided not to renew my subscription. Even so, Cord‚Äôs profile caught my eye, with his pictures of his travels, his dog, and sense of humor. We messaged briefly before my subscription was ending, and with my crazy schedule, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with eHarmony anymore so we went to email. After so many loser dates, I didn‚Äôt want to just start dating Cord, and so I made him wait until we knew each other enough to even talk to him on the phone! Eventually we texted, and then I caved, and I allowed him to call me. That lead to a date that was oddly comfortable but nerve wrecking regardless. I couldn‚Äôt believe this guy would rather stay in this boring little town for two weeks to see me again rather than go to Maui (not going to lie, I thought that was just crazy talk&hellip; still flattering though).</p>
            <p>I don‚Äôt believe in love at first sight, but at some point, it became love between the both of us. It didn‚Äôt take long. Those first few dates were honestly the most comfortable dates that I had ever been on&hellip; and will ever be on. Probably the shyest guy I have ever met, I know I keep opening Cord up even more as the days go by, and I push him to meet people and go out. I‚Äôve introduced him to good Lebanese food (he‚Äôs perfecting his hummus recipe), decorating like an elf threw up for Christmas, and the joys of getting friends together for the hell of it. The most important thing I can say is that Cord has been able to pull out the best of me with his constant acceptance and encouragement, making me the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. I can honestly say I am marrying my best friend, and I‚Äôm so blessed to be doing so.</p>

          <div class="flex--split story__take story__take--cord">
            <h3 class="copy--center">Cord&rsquo;s Take</h3>
            <img class="person__img" src="assets/img/cord.jpg" alt="Cord Nowell" title="Cord Nowell">
            <p>Shy and not outgoing enough, I was coerced into joining the online dating website eHarmony by my friend Nick. I have a small handful of friends, but I am no social butterfly and needed a little encouragement to actually dip my toe into the online dating world.</p>
            <p>I was fed up with the bar hopping want-to-come-to-my-place scene. So, I grabbed my credit card, a few alcoholic beverages for courage and created my eHarmony profile.</p>
            <p>Stella got the ball rolling and reached out to me. She made the first move and sent a message to me saying she fancied me, but her subscription was ending in a day and she gave me her email. Stella's snarky humor was evident in her profile. I also liked the fact she had a dog and had fairly good taste in music.</p>
            <p>After a week of emails and texts, I finally persuaded Stella to talk to me on the phone. From there, it was time our first date and we meet for drinks in downtown Mountain View. We were both nervous beyond belief, but we had chemistry from the start. During the date I became annoyed at the state of Hawaii of all things. I was leaving for 10 days in Maui two days later, and I did not want to go. I already knew I wanted to see Stella again and 10 days seemed like it would be torture.</p>
            <p>Ever since, we have continued to fall more and more in love. Stella has accepted my intense love of sports and has even become quite the Giants fan herself. I have exposed her to crazy family camping trips, paddle boarding, and a vast world of odd movies that I love. My odd quirks and dorky personality are embraced and we have become quite the team. I guess we lucked out. Randomly finding love from the click of a mouse is not something I was expecting, but I sure am thankful.</p>
